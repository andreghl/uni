This repository contains some of the code I have written (as of now) during my studies. The different folder names represent the various courses in the Economics & Business Economics or Econometrics & Operations Research program I have taken. The repo (and the code within it) is quite messy but it should give a good idea of my coding style.

| Course Code | Course Name |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| EBC2090 | Empirical Econometrics   |
| EBC2107 | Mathematical Statistics  |
| EBC2111 | Econometric Methods 1    |
| EBC2173 | Labour Economics         |
