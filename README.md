This repository contains some of the code I have written (as of now) during my studies. The different folder names represent the various courses in the Economics & Business Economics or Econometrics & Operations Research program I have taken. The repo (and the code within it) is quite messy but it should give a good idea of my coding style.

| EBC2090 | Empirical Econometrics   | Time Series Analysis |
| EBC2107 | Mathematical Statistics  | Statistics |
